This project was created to replicate a mockup given by a third party. It is fairly primitive as I sought to challenge myself.
Instead of using existing libraries (for example MUI), I utilized HTML and CSS to create my own Card components. Although they
do not match up with typical Card objects you would find in most applications, this was purposefully done to match the requirements
of the mockup itself. Through this project I learned a lot about JSX and utilizing the basics of the React.js framework, as well as
CSS styling and inheritance. I even enjoyed creating my own custom methods to capitalize words and format numbers into prices, in order
to better practice algorithms. For a more detailed React.js project, where I utilize more advanced React elements such as Routes, Hooks,
and API calls, please see my GymExercises project, linked in my portfolio repository.
